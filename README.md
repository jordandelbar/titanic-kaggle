# :ship: Titanic Project

[![Python 3.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)


## :memo: Context

This is the legacy branch of my Titanic project. 
There is two main folders in this repository:
- `titanic_model`: 
    Train a model and then upload it as a python library on a [Gemfury] private pypi server
- `titanic_api`:
    Build a [FastAPI] api and then deploy it on a [Heroku] server


Both folder have a dedicated README where you can find the instructions to run the different codes.
